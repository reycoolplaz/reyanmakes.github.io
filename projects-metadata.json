I didn't have a fixed end result in my mind, it evolved with constant problem-solving and continuous learning process. \n\nI collected materials, taught myself welding, then through trial, testing and several iterations slowly able to shape the vehicle. As the build progressed I engaged my friends in the process and formed a small team of 3 including me. Together we faced structural and mechanical challenges, brainstormed, troubleshooting issues as they emerged and adapted the design in real-time. \n\nThe final result is a working go-kart and a record of the entire process of learning by building, facing challenges, problem solving, continuous learning and collaboration. It proves something useful can be built with creativity, effort, problem-solving skill without a big budget. \n",

      "description": "This project began with a practical problem. In a small kids bedroom, a standard twin bed occupied most of the available space, leaving no room for small friend gatherings. When my existing bed frame broke, it pushed me to rethink my space entirely.\n\nI decided to design and build a simple loft bed that would elevate the sleeping area and free up space underneath for a small sofa and a utility shelf. My goals were to keep costs low and reuse the mattress and parts of the broken bed frame instead of buying new ones.\n\nI planned the design by drawing a full blueprint on a whiteboard, which helped me think through dimensions, structure, and material usage while clearly communicating the plan to my parents. The bed was constructed using stud pine and recycled components, keeping the design simple and rustic. Once assembled, the room felt more open, brighter, and organized.",

      "description": "This shelf was a small furniture project intended to function as a floating wall shelf for displaying personal objects. Later when I redesigned my room around the loft bed, the shelf lost its original placement and found a new place under the loft. I modified the piece to rest on the structural support beam of the loft frame, allowing it to serve as a storage and display surface area above the sofa.\n\nThe shelf is primarily constructed from plywood, it has chamfered edges to soften the form and improve visual balance. A flat back was incorporated to increase structural stability against the beam. Finished with Sedona Red stain, the piece complements the surrounding wood tones while standing out as a deliberate design element.\n",

      "description": "A self-initiated woodworking project designed and built as a gift for my mom. Created to replace expensive, over-ornamented mass-produced temples with a simple, open, and sturdy design that fits our home decor and was built on a very low budget.\n\nI realized that these temples sold in shops were structurally no different from tables with added decoration, and I decided to design and build one myself. The store bought ones are not so efficient in terms of internal space usage and they always look like overly decorated closed boxes. My goal was to create something sturdy, minimal, and intentional while keeping costs extremely low.\n\nThe temple was built using plywood and stair railings, supported by reused sofa feet and a recycled bed backboard, with trim added as nice decoration. Working within a budget of around fifty dollars pushed me to think critically about material selection and recycle unused materials. The temple construction reflects how thoughtful design and efficient material use can replace expensive, mass-produced objects with something personal and efficient. \n",

These are my absolute favourite pieces, reflecting my early maker journey and remain displayed in my room as  room decor.\n\nWhile making the wooden cane I focused on surface refinement through hours of hand sanding and waxing. I experimented with an ancient Japanese wood-preservation technique called Shou Sugi Ban on the handle to study texture and durability.\n\nSeveral sketches have been done before finalizing the design of the knives. Those require careful consideration of proportion, grip, and structure. Together, these projects built my foundation in craftsmanship, iterative design, and material exploration, and prepared me for more bigger projects later on.\n",

Lake house drawing is the inside of a lake house I built in the fall-winter-spring of 2022-23. \n\nThe lake house was built beside my neighboring creek, since it was in an open space inside woods, and got destroyed eventually.

The goal was to convert an overgrown patch of land into a clean, low-maintenance planting area that would remain functional for years.\nThe site was originally covered in dense creeping juniper and required extensive preparation. The area was a long rectangle with one end rounded off into a semi-circle. The process involved clearing existing vegetation, leveling the area, installing weed-prevention fabric, and applying mulch before any planting could begin.\nAll plants selected were perennials to ensure durability and minimal maintenance. The final layout included large rose bushes as focal points, supported by smaller mum bushes to add variation.\nWhile the actual build was completed in three days, the project required months of preparation beforehand, including documentation, approval process, scheduling meeting and coordination. I led a volunteer team of approximately eleven people, managing task assignments and communication throughout the build.\nThis project strengthened my leadership and communication ability to plan at scale, lead a team efficiently, and navigate formal approval processes while delivering a clean design through hands-on execution.\n",
