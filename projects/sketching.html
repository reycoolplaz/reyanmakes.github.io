    <title>Sketches & Drawings | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="I love to put as much detail in a sketch, it helps me concentrate, I can't stop as long as I get a perfect balance in the object in space. The still-life was done in a hurry while I visited MET, NYC with my mom and sister. 

I purposefully made the sketches more flowy, less detail oriented, kind of loosening my style with quick sketches. The architecture drawings are part of my summer course at HCAD. Lake house drawing is the inside of a lake house I built in the fall-winter-spring of 2022-23. 

The lake house was built beside my neighboring creek, since it was in an open space inside woods, and got destroyed eventually. But it was a wonderful memory, my first big project out of scrap and recycled materials.
