    <title>Go-Kart | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The project began as an exploration of how far I can push my creativity and problem-solving skills with scrap materials and spare parts with limited budget and no formal training. I didn't have a fixed end result in my mind, it evolved with constant problem-solving and continuous learning process. 

I collected materials, taught myself welding, then through trial, testing and several iterations slowly able to shape the vehicle. As the build progressed I engaged my friends in the process and formed a small team of 3 including me. Together we faced structural and mechanical challenges, brainstormed, troubleshooting issues as they emerged and adapted the design in real-time. 

The final result is a working go-kart and a record of the entire process of learning by building, facing challenges, problem solving, continuous learning and collaboration. It proves something useful can be built with creativity, effort, problem-solving skill without a big budget
