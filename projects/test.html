    <title>Boys Scout Eagle Project  | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="For my BSA Eagle project. I planned, and built a garden bed for a local temple. I had a group of 11 people give or take that had helped me out with this project as volunteers. The garden bed was a long rectangle with one end rounded off into a semi-circle. 

The whole patch of earth was covered in creeping juniper bushes and needed to be cleaned up, have weed preventive fabric installed, and mulched before we could begin adding the plants. The plants that I ended up choosing were all perennials, being three large rose bushes, and a few smaller bushes of mums. The entire project took only 3 days, and was relatively easy compared to the prep work that had come before it. 

While the actual project had only taken 3 days, the paperwork and getting everything approved had taken months. This project has shown me not only how to properly manage and utilize a team efficiently, but also how to handle paperwork, and communicate professionally while doing so.
