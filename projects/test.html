    <title>BSA Eagle Project  | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A garden bed for a local temple, this community project was my BSA Eagle Scout service project, where I was responsible for the full planning, design, execution leading a team of 11 volunteers throughout the process. The goal was to convert an overgrown patch of land into a clean, low-maintenance planting area that would remain functional for years.

The site was originally covered in dense creeping juniper and required extensive preparation. The area was a long rectangle with one end rounded off into a semi-circle. The process involved clearing existing vegetation, leveling the area, installing weed-prevention fabric, and applying mulch before any planting could begin.

Perennials were selected to ensure durability and minimal maintenance. The final layout included large rose bushes surrounded by smaller mum bushes to add variation.

While the actual build was completed in three days, the project required months of preparation beforehand, including documentation, approval process, scheduling meeting and coordination among volunteers. This project strengthened my leadership and communication ability to plan at scale, navigate formal approval processes and lead a team for actual execution.
