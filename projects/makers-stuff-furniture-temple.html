    <title>Temple Construction | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="My mom wanted a temple for our home, but the ones available in stores were expensive and heavily ornamented. The size she wanted cost between $1500–$2000, and most designs felt like closed, decorative boxes that did not match the simple and open aesthetic of our house.

I realized that these temples were structurally no different from tables with added decoration, and I decided to design and build one myself. My goal was to create something sturdy, open, minimal, and functional rather than decorative. 

Working with basic materials and tools, I built the entire piece for around fifty dollars. The project pushed me to think critically about design efficiency, cost and material efficiency. A thoughtful design and efficient material use can replace expensive, mass-produced objects with something personal and intentional.
