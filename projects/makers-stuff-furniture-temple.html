    <title>Temple Construction | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A self-initiated woodworking project designed and built as a gift for my mom. Created to replace expensive, over-ornamented mass-produced temples with a simple, open, and sturdy design that fits our home decor and was built on a very low budget.

I realized that these temples sold in shops were structurally no different from tables with added decoration, and I decided to design and build one myself. The store bought ones are not so efficient in terms of internal space usage and they always look like overly decorated closed boxes. My goal was to create something sturdy, minimal, and intentional while keeping costs extremely low.

The temple was built using plywood and stair railings, supported by reused sofa feet and a recycled bed backboard, with trim added as nice decoration. Working within a budget of around fifty dollars pushed me to think critically about material selection and recycle unused materials. The temple construction reflects how thoughtful design and efficient material use can replace expensive, mass-produced objects with something personal and efficient. ">
