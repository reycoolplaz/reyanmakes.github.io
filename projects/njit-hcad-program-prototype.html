    <title>NJIT Cave Shed Prototype | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This project was part of a two week long NJIT summer course that I had attended the summer of junior year. The Cave had been designed as a shelter in Harriet Tubman Park, next to the NJIT campus. I had designed the cave to resemble that of a hill, or other natural sloped structure, where people could take shelter under, but wouldn't look too out of place, or not integrated within the park. The Cave was also made out of only two pieces of flat plywood, that were scored and bent to make the ‘Cave’ shape. This was a design challenge I had given myself because it had made the structure stand out, look more well rounded, and meant it could be easily replicated with a variety of materials.

Throughout this course, we were taught how to use all sorts of basic blueprinting, and drafting tools like CAD, and hand-drawing skills. This taught me a lot about making blueprints, and how to make scale drawings of my creations. I hope to continue using the knowledge, not only in school and professional settings, but also on my own personal projects going forward.">
