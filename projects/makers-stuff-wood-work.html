    <title>Woodworking Projects | Reyan Makes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="These woodworking projects were created during my freshman and sophomore years when I was exploring form, material, and process. These are my absolute favourite pieces, reflecting my early maker journey and remain displayed in my room as  room decor.

While making the wooden cane I focused on surface refinement through hours of hand sanding and waxing. I experimented with an ancient Japanese wood-preservation technique called Shou Sugi Ban on the handle to study texture and durability.

Several sketches have been done before finalizing the design of the knives. Those require careful consideration of proportion, grip, and structure. Together, these projects built my foundation in craftsmanship, iterative design, and material exploration, and prepared me for more bigger projects later on.">
