                        <p class="project-description">This project began as my BSA Eagle Scout service project, where I was responsible for the full planning, design, execution of a permanent garden bed for a local temple leading a team of 11 volunteers throughout the process. The goal was to convert an overgrown patch of land into a clean, low-maintenance planting area that would remain functional for years.
The site was originally covered in dense creeping juniper and required extensive preparation. The area was a long rectangle with one end rounded off into a semi-circle. The process involved clearing existing vegetation, leveling the area, installing weed-prevention fabric, and applying mulch before any planting could begin.
All plants selected were perennials to ensure durability and minimal maintenance. The final layout included large rose bushes as focal points, supported by smaller mum bushes to add variation.
While the actual build was completed in three days, the project required months of preparation beforehand, including documentation, approval process, scheduling meeting and coordination. I led a volunteer team of approximately eleven people, managing task assignments and communication throughout the build.
This project strengthened my leadership and communication ability to plan at scale, lead a team efficiently, and navigate formal approval processes while delivering a clean design through hands-on execution.

While a shed may sound simple, the structure measured approximately 11 feet by 8 feet, close to a small room than a typical backyard build.

Because of the scale and complexity of the project, experienced professionals guided us through the process, introducing proper construction techniques and safety practices. This was my first opportunity to work alongside professionals in the field, observe how large projects are executed step by step, and understand how teamwork and expertise come together to solve real problems.

This project taught me how hands-on collaboration, planning, and proper guidance can turn an idea into a finished structure.

I purposefully made the sketches more flowy, less detail oriented, kind of loosening my style with quick sketches. The architecture drawings are part of my summer course at HCAD. Lake house drawing is the inside of a lake house I built in the fall-winter-spring of 2022-23. 

The lake house was built beside my neighboring creek, since it was in an open space inside woods, and got destroyed eventually. But it was a wonderful memory, my first big project out of scrap and recycled materials.
