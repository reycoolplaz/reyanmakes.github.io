I didn't have a fixed end result in my mind, it evolved with constant problem-solving and continuous learning process. \n\nI collected materials, taught myself welding, then through trial, testing and several iterations slowly able to shape the vehicle. As the build progressed I engaged my friends in the process and formed a small team of 3 including me. Together we faced structural and mechanical challenges, brainstormed, troubleshooting issues as they emerged and adapted the design in real-time. \n\nThe final result is a working go-kart and a record of the entire process of learning by building, facing challenges, problem solving, continuous learning and collaboration. It proves something useful can be built with creativity, effort, problem-solving skill without a big budget. \n",

      "description": "This project began with a practical problem. In a small kids bedroom, a standard twin bed occupied most of the available space, leaving no room for small friend gatherings. When my existing bed frame broke, it pushed me to rethink my space entirely.\n\nI decided to design and build a simple loft bed that would elevate the sleeping area and free up space underneath for a small sofa and a utility shelf. My goals were to keep costs low and reuse the mattress and parts of the broken bed frame instead of buying new ones.\n\nI planned the design by drawing a full blueprint on a whiteboard, which helped me think through dimensions, structure, and material usage while clearly communicating the plan to my parents. The bed was constructed using stud pine and recycled components, keeping the design simple and rustic. Once assembled, the room felt more open, brighter, and organized.",

The size she wanted cost between $1500\u2013$2000, and most designs felt like closed, decorative boxes that did not match the simple and open aesthetic of our house.\n\nI realized that these temples were structurally no different from tables with added decoration, and I decided to design and build one myself. My goal was to create something sturdy, open, minimal, and functional rather than decorative. \n\nWorking with basic materials and tools, I built the entire piece for around fifty dollars. The project pushed me to think critically about design efficiency, cost and material efficiency. A thoughtful design and efficient material use can replace expensive, mass-produced objects with something personal and intentional. \n",

These are my absolute favourite pieces, reflecting my early maker journey and remain displayed in my room as  room decor.\n\nWhile making the wooden cane I focused on surface refinement through hours of hand sanding and waxing. I experimented with an ancient Japanese wood-preservation technique called Shou Sugi Ban on the handle to study texture and durability.\n\nSeveral sketches have been done before finalizing the design of the knives. Those require careful consideration of proportion, grip, and structure. Together, these projects built my foundation in craftsmanship, iterative design, and material exploration, and prepared me for more bigger projects later on.\n",

The architecture drawings are part of my summer course at HCAD. Lake house drawing is the inside of a lake house I built in the fall-winter-spring of 2022-23. \n\nThe lake house was built beside my neighboring creek, since it was in an open space inside woods, and got destroyed eventually.

The garden bed was a long rectangle with one end rounded off into a semi-circle. \n\nThe whole patch of earth was covered in creeping juniper bushes and needed to be cleaned up, have weed preventive fabric installed, and mulched before we could begin adding the plants. The plants that I ended up choosing were all perennials, being three large rose bushes, and a few smaller bushes of mums. The entire project took only 3 days, and was relatively easy compared to the prep work that had come before it. \n\nWhile the actual project had only taken 3 days, the paperwork and getting everything approved had taken months. This project has shown me not only how to properly manage and utilize a team efficiently, but also how to handle paperwork, and communicate professionally while doing so.\n",
